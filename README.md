Objective: The objective of this project is to create a simple a Python program 
to track and manage student grades. Theprogram should allow the user to input grades
for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the
overall grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or GPA).


Key Features:
User Input:
The program prompts the user to enter the marks for six predefined 
subjects: Telugu, Hindi, English, Maths, Science, and Social Studies.
Average Calculation:
The program computes the average of the six input marks. This is done by summing 
the marks for all subjects and then dividing by the number of subjects (6).
Grade Determination:
Based on the calculated average, the program assigns a grade using the following 
criteria:
Grade A: Average is 90 or above.
Grade B: Average is 80-89.
Grade C: Average is 70-79.
Grade D: Average is 60-69.
Grade F: Average is below 60.

Output:
The program displays the calculated average and the corresponding grade to the user.

Technologies Used:
Python: The program is implemented in Python, using basic constructs such as input/output
operations, arithmetic calculations, and conditional statements.
